# Why use HPC systems?

To do science in the real world we have to build complicated instruments for each experiment: vast telescopes for astronomers to look deep into space, powerful particle accelerators so physicists can smash atoms together at almost the speed of light, or enormous wind tunnels where engineers can study how an aeroplane wing will operate in flight.

However, some problems are actually too large, too distant or too dangerous to study directly: we cannot experiment on the earthâ€™s weather to study climate change, we cannot travel thousands of light years into space to watch two galaxies collide, and we cannot dive into the centre of the sun to measure the nuclear reactions that generate its enormous heat. However, one supercomputer can run different computer programs that reproduce all of these experiments inside its own memory.

This gives the modern scientist a powerful new tool to study the real world in a virtual environment. The process of running a virtual experiment is called computer simulation. Compared to disciplines such as chemistry, biology and physics it is a relatively new area of research which has been around for a matter of decades rather than centuries. This new area, which many view as a third pillar of science which extends the two traditional approaches of theory and experiment, is called computational science and its practitioners are computational scientists.
