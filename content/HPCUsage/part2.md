# Version control

One common issue when developing code or settign up configuration is precisely capturing the current state of the code you are working on saving it frequently and sharing it with others. Version control systems like git allow you capture changes and track them. Web services like github or gitlab allow for this to be backed up online and shared to collaborators.
