# Performance concepts

We use a high performance computer due to some limitiation with the problem we are trying to solve that means we require a large quantitiy of memory or have a large amount of computation to do.

While HPC systems allow up to scale to make our computations possible they are expencive peices of kit that need to be used efficently.

Therefore understanding the performance characteristics your codes and knowing how to interprit the scaling of performance as the number of MPI processes and nodes increases allows for users to optimise the use of these systems.

Given that compute allocations are awarded in hours using a given node or core on the machine finding the optimal time to solution for your given problem may allow you to get more data out of a machine for your project.
